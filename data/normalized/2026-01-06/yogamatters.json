    "description": "Sustainability innovation at its best - a yoga mat that actually helps to clean the environment!\nThe Yogamatters Aqua Evolve yoga mat is made from a unique combination of EVA foam and algae from lakes and ponds. \nAlgae blooms pose a major problem for communities around the world causing eco-systems to become out of balance. They are caused by factors such as climate change, water pollution from agriculture, industry and society.\nOur partners at BLOOM have found an innovative way of helping the environment by turning algae blooms into eco-foams for use in products. \nDuring algae harvesting, the algae is separated from the water and the clean, filtered and oxygenated water is returned back into the environment. Helping to restore the eco-system. Algae also absorbs and traps CO2 from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. When the algae is harvested, the CO2 comes along with it, which means cleaner air too!\nFor every mat, 64 litres of cleaned water are returned to the local habitat as well as 40 cubic metres of clean air. \n\nUses reclaimed/recycled materials certified by the Global Recycling Standard (GRS) \nEco-friendly\nVegan\nLightweight and portable at 750 grams\nFree from latex, PVC, toxic chemicals and dyes\n5mm thickness for super cushioning\nMade in Spain\n\nPlease keep the mat out of direct sunlight and hot places. Store in a cool, dry place.",

Sustainably manufactured from recycled non-Amazon harvested tree rubber, the eKO lite supports both your practice and our planet.\nAll Manduka eKO® Series yoga mats have a closed-cell surface, which will never absorb moisture. Because of this, if you are warm or sweaty, the yoga mat will feel slippery, so we always recommend pairing it with a hand towel to absorb moisture and provide extra traction or to apply Yoga Grip Gel during your practice. If you're practicing hot yoga, we recommend a mat towel for full mat coverage.",

    "description": "The ecoYoga biodegradable yoga mat is both practical and ethical for beginners and experienced students alike. With a pure rubber underside for a firm grip on the floor, this eco-friendly yoga mat boasts a surface layer blend of natural hessian/jute fabric and a unique 100% natural rubber compound which provides an excellent non slip surface for your yoga practice.\n\nmade in the UK\nsustainable plant-based materials\nsuitable for vegans\n100% natural rubber (contains latex)\nbiodegradable\nexcellent grip / non-slip\n\nPlease note that the weave of the jute is such that some loose threads and nubs are normal. There is also a 10% allowance on the jute exposure as 100% natural raw materials will not always be 100% consistent. Due to the nature of the materials, if the mat is subject to very heavy use, it may degrade quicker than some other less eco-friendly mats. Colours can have slight variations. Also, 100% natural rubber has a tendency to bloom which can appear on the surface as a mild dusty coating - it can be wiped off with water.",

    "description": "The Cork Yoga Mat is the most sustainable choice within yoga mats.\nCork is lightweight, allowing for more efficient shipping to the factory. The yoga mat cork is supported by a base of natural non-slip rubber from Vietnam. Only water-based inks are used for the prints, leaving you with a fully sustainable and beautiful piece of art. Cork is antimicrobial, meaning you don’t need harmful chemicals to clean your collection. Organic soap and water are sufficient and if you get any major stains, you can actually file down the cork a bit and avoid cleaners altogether!\n\nDesigned to love the earth and your practice\nNon-slip grip that improves with sweat\nHigh-density cushion for support\nDurable: Premium quality for the most rigorous studio conditions or at home\nEco-friendly: biodegradable natural cork and rubber with water-based inks\nFree from silicone, pvc, and phthalates\nEasy to Clean: antimicrobial cork\nIncludes carrying strap\n\n\nCork trees grow around the Mediterranean naturally and on farms. The mat cork is sourced and certified from tree farms in Portugal. The bark of the cork tree can be harvested every 9-10 years during its 200-year life span. The tree is not harmed during the process; it actually allows for greater absorption of CO2 while the bark regrows.\nIf a tree does reach its end life, two new saplings are planted in its place thus ensuring the cork forest continues to flourish and renew. The harvested cork bark is shredded to a pulp and pressed into long sheets to be used in products. Any leftover cork dust is used to fuel the mills.\nIf you no longer need your products, cork is compostable. Better yet, you can find a local agency to upcycle your cork or find DIY inspiration online to upcycle your cork.",

They're perfect for all kinds of yoga, including Ashtanga, outdoor classes, and beach yoga. \nJade`s Mysore rugs are handwoven by rural artisans in India, preserving a tradition and art form and providing a livelihood for weavers. Weaving is a traditional way of life for many people in this region, which has experienced an enormous decline in recent years due to increasing industrialization. These rugs support the traditional weavers and enable them to use their skills to support their families as well as to keep this tradition alive.\nThey are made with organic cotton and all natural vegetable dyes made from herbs including indigo, cumin and turmeric. The herbal dyes are specially made in small batches in order to get the most color and benefits from the herbs.\nThese rugs are lightweight at only 1.13kg and can easily be taken outdoors to the park or the beach. They are also machine washable with cold water, making them easy to care for. (note that rugs may shrink slightly in the wash). Wash colours separately and hang to air dry (will shrink if put in a dryer).\nWhen using on hard surfaces such as hardwood, laminate and tile floors, please use on top of your Jade mat (natural rubber mats) or other non-slip underlay to prevent slipping.\nWith the purchase of each rug, Jade provides a week of hot lunches to a child in need in India.\nMeasurements:Thickness: 1/8\" (3mm)Width: 27\" (68.6cm)Length: 72\" (183cm)Weight: 1.1kg",

    "description": "The Cork Yoga Mat is the most sustainable choice within yoga mats.\nCork is lightweight, allowing for more efficient shipping to the factory. The yoga mat cork is supported by a base of natural non-slip rubber from Vietnam. Only water-based inks are used for the prints, leaving you with a fully sustainable and beautiful piece of art. Cork is antimicrobial, meaning you don’t need harmful chemicals to clean your collection. Organic soap and water are sufficient and if you get any major stains, you can actually file down the cork a bit and avoid cleaners altogether!\n\nDesigned to love the earth and your practice.\nNon-slip grip that improves with sweat\nSymmetrical design aids alignment\nHigh-density cushion for support\nDurable: Premium quality for the most rigorous studio conditions or at home\nEco-friendly: biodegradable natural cork and rubber with water-based inks.\nFree from silicone, pvc, and phthalates\nEasy to Clean: antimicrobial cork\nIncludes carrying strap\n\nCork trees grow around the Mediterranean naturally and on farms. The mat cork is sourced and certified from tree farms in Portugal. The bark of the cork tree can be harvested every 9-10 years during its 200-year life span. The tree is not harmed during the process; it actually allows for greater absorption of CO2 while the bark regrows.\nIf a tree does reach its end life, two new saplings are planted in its place thus ensuring the cork forest continues to flourish and renew. The harvested cork bark is shredded to a pulp and pressed into long sheets to be used in products. Any leftover cork dust is used to fuel the mills.\nIf you no longer need your products, cork is compostable. Better yet, you can find a local agency to upcycle your cork or find DIY inspiration online to upcycle your cork.",
