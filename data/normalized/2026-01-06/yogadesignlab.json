    "description": "THE CORK MAT\n\nUnlike most of our competition, our Cork Mat is made with a 100% natural rubber base layer topped with a renewable, sustainable cork top layer.\nWhile natural cork provides superior wet and dry grip, it is ideal in heated and hot yoga classes because as temperatures rise, cork begins to loosen and becomes softer & easier to grip. It's also moisture-activated - becoming grippier as it gets wet. Truly nature's best solution for towel-free traction. Cork is also closed-cell and naturally anti-microbial, sealing out moisture & resisting odor and bacteria from sweat.\nOur natural rubber base layer offers a unique springy ride that cushions and protects joints, while also remaining stable and supportive in any pose. Stays put on the floor better than foam base layers and provides denser cushioning.\nThe stunning, symmetrical pattern helps guide alignment, and is printed using a non-fade water-based ink.\nNote:  The foldable 1.5mm option is excellent for yogis on the go, and also provides an excellent non-slip, natural \"topper\" to other mats.\n\n\n\n PRO TIP\n\nFor optimal grip, lightly spritz your mat with water before practice.\n\n\n\n DURABLE\n\nSupports any practice from a high intensity workout to a gentle flow. Suitable for shoes.\n\n\n\n EARTH CONSCIOUS\n\n \n\nSustainable, renewable cork top layer made from the outer layer of bark from the cork oak tree. (Cork trees are the only tree in the world that regenerate stripped bark.)\nBase layer is made with natural, non-Amazonian harvested tree rubber.\nAll of our beautiful designs are printed with water-based inks.\nPhthalate, silicone and toxin-fee.\n\n\n\n\n CARE INSTRUCTIONS\n\nTo clean, wipe with a soft towel dampened with soap and water; lay flat or hang to air dry.\nRoll with the colored/designed side on the outside.\n\n\n\n DIMENSIONS\n\n70\"(178 cm) long x 24\"(61 cm) wide\n1.5mm thick = 3.5 lb (1.6 kg)\nIncludes carrying strap",
