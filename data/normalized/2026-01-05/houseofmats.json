    "description": "CONOCE A LA ARTISTA\nJESS GUZMAN, Colombiana, Arquitecta de profesión y artista de vocación. Me encuentro muy inclinado hacia la pintura; dibuja y pinta desde niña porque eso la hace sentir libre. Encuentra en lápiz y papel la manera de materializar sus pensamientos y emociones.\nSuele inspirarse en las formas de la naturaleza, y su estilo es una mezcla entre boceto, caricatura y abstracción.\nLa idea de dibujar para House of Mats la entusiasmó. Le encanta el concepto que Lucía, la dueña, tiene de la marca, pero más que eso, la historia que hay detrás y las razones que la motivaron.\nLas ilustraciones de House surgen del concepto mismo de la marca: los colores, las posturas, la conexión con la naturaleza, la energía del sol y del universo, dando como resultado una serie de imágenes sencillas, realizadas a mano con un trazo suave, la que comunican los conceptos básicos del yoga.\nNada es absoluto, todo es complementario, y de ese tránsito surge la idea.\nSobre el diseño: El elefante en general es un animal que se asemeja a los humanos, es sociable y disfruta de la unión familiar. Además, los elefantes crean fuertes lazos con su familia y amigos, hasta el punto de poder identificarse después de un tiempo sin verse.",
