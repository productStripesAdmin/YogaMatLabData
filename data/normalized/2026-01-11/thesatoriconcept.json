I chose the elegant butterfly Koi, known for their long, flowing fins and tails, adding a touch of beauty and movement to the design. Complementing the koi, water lettuce has been included for its decorative appeal, enhancing the overall aesthetic and staying true to the initial concept. In Japanese culture, Koi fish symbolize luck and prosperity, while the waterlilies, akin to lotuses, represent rebirth and resurrection.\" \nThis artwork is brought to you by Yohanes Ragil, an Illustrator/Graphic Designer based in Bali, Indonesia. His works are usually inspired by nature and cultures (especially Southeast Asian) with a style inspired by lino-cut technique in a monochromatic palette. \nFree gift : Carry strap is included",

    "description": "This artwork is created by Emma Hall : \"I was really inspired by retro floral patterns from the 60s and 70s that use this clearly hand-drawn element to create a more fun and organic pattern. My aim was to infuse these patterns with modern colors and details to give them a more modern edge. To create the design I use purely hand-drawings which are then scanned and vectorised to allow resizing and colouring.\"Emma is a British designer from Cambridge. Her biggest joy in her work is colour. The process involved usually centres around mixing analogue and digital methods. Subjects are generally drawn from nature, such as, imagined or real African landscapes, wildflowers and animals. Her travels growing up and Mozambican heritage may have also contributed to these interests. This design is featured on a premium vegan suede yoga mat, combining Emma's vibrant artistry with eco-conscious functionality.\nFree gift : Carry strap is included\nFeatured on The Yoga Nomads",
