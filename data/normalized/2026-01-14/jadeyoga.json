Practicing on it was a dream, it had great grip, and it's thick enough so it was cushiony but firm as well. The feel and thickness are on point. I would recommend this mat to all Ashtangis for their daily yoga practice.”",

Weaving is a traditional way of life for many people in this area of India and has seen a massive decline in recent years as it can be very difficult to make a living with weaving and many people have left in search of other jobs. These rugs support the traditional weavers and allow them to use their skills to support their families. For many of them, this is the only job they have ever had and making these rugs allows them to keep this tradition alive. Please click here to hear our weaver talk about his work. \n\nBe The Change: Through our partnership with the Akshaya Patra Foundation, with each Darbha Grass meditation mat purchased, Jade will provide a week of hot lunches for a child in India.",

LWH seeks to empower and educate women, enabling them to write their own destinies.\n\nEmpowering Women: LWH provides a safe space for women who have escaped abusive practices in the textile industry and other injustices in their local communities. Their manufacturing facilities allow these women to learn new skills and crafts as a group to help heal and rehabilitate their spirits.\n\nEthical Fashion: Through raising awareness and making fashion an ethical way, their goal is to end childhood slavery, forced marriage, and other injustices against women.\n\nDimensions: 24\" x 72\"\n\nCare Instructions: Washing: Hand wash or machine wash on gentle cycle, opt for cold water as often as possible. Use lukewarm water when needed. Do not use bleach. Drying: We recommend air-dry only. Do not tumble dry. Our upcycled materials are mainly made from silk fabrics and other materials, silk is very delicate and the high temperatures of the tumble dryer can shrink or damage your silks. Ironing: Iron on low setting if needed.\n\n\n*Please note that every rug is handmade and colors will vary.",

    "description": "The Perfect Mat For Hot Yoga!\n\nEco-Friendly: Made with sustainably harvested cork and natural rubber, rapidly renewable resources and contains no PVC*\n\nGreat Grip: Cork provides outstanding grip for hot yoga or other sweaty practices\n\nComfortable: Natural rubber base provides more comfort and resilience \n\n\nDimensions:  4.5mm thick, 24\" wide, and 72\" long and weight approximately 5 lbs\n\nBe The Change: Through our partnership with Trees for the Future, JADE PLANTS A TREE FOR EVERY MAT SOLD – with over TWO MILLION trees planted so far.\n\n\n*Made in Spain, the surface of the Jade Cork mat is harvested sustainably from cork trees in Portugal. Trees are not cut down, but after the tree is 25 years old, the bark of the tree is removed. This is repeated every 9 years, with the bark regenerating in the interim - absorbing additional CO2 during this process.\n*To Clean: Cork mats can be washed with soap and water then rinsed with water. Hang inside to dry.  Store rolled with cork side out.\n*Please note that colors on the screen are approximations and do not match the mats exactly; if you would like to know the exact color of our mats, please visit one of our retailers or email us to request a free sample swatch.",
