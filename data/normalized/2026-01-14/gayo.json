          "Pretty soft and with a yoga towel it's got good grip",
          "Tried it for the first time this morning at hot yoga. Loved it! Nice and grippy! Others reviewing mentioned it's heaviness. Although heavier than a foam mat, I didn't think it was too heavy at all. In fact I probably wouldn't have noticed the weight had my read about it in the reviews. I appreciate the sturdiness of the construction and in addition, it is quite beautiful. Not sure how it will hold up over time but so far so good! Loved that it came with a carrying strap.",
          "I've been using the Gayo Cork Yoga Mat for a few weeks now, and I’m really impressed. The cork surface provides excellent grip, even during sweaty sessions, which keeps me stable in all my poses. It’s also eco-friendly, which is a big plus for me. The thickness is just right — it offers great cushioning without feeling too soft. It also has a strap where we could carry the mat easily.Overall, it’s a high-quality mat that combines functionality with sustainability. I would definitely recommend it to any yoga enthusiast!",
          "Love the feel of the cork mat. Simple design, non slip even in hot yoga. Wipe clean, roll up and go. Heavier than regular mat due to cork and rubber base. Weighs about 7 lbs. Well worth the money!",
          "It's a wonderful mat! I love its length and thickness, and it's not slippery. I feel very comfortable doing my positions on it. I love it!",

It’s a great value for your money considering it’s your health! It doesn’t slip during my practice at home (on a rug on top of wood floors) it might slip on a hard wood floor but I haven’t tried it so I can’t say for sure. The mat itself is really thick which I love since that means it’s more cushy for me and will be more durable in the long run.

          "I’ve been practicing yoga for almost 8 years and tried a lot of mats. This mat is one of the best I’ve practiced on. It has an amazing grip which helps to hold your asanas. No sliding hands or feet. In addition, the mat provides a great cushion for your knees, elbow or head. But even though it is thick, it is not heavy which is great. I also like the alignment feature which can help to alight your poses. With a full confidence I can say that this mat meets, if not exceeds, the quality of other leading mat brands that charge two or three times more for their products. I am very happy with this mat and I recommend it to everyone who is looking for a quality product, without breaking a bank.",
          "I absolutely love this yoga mat! From the moment I unboxed it (which, by the way, I truly appreciated—it came double boxed, so no worries about it getting crushed in shipping), I could tell it was high quality. The grip is fantastic, even during more intense flows, and the 4mm thickness provides just the right balance of comfort and support for my joints. The alignment lines are a great touch, helping me refine my poses and stay centered during practice.It’s lightweight yet durable, making it easy to carry to different spaces, and the eco-friendly materials give me peace of mind. I love it so much that I’m purchasing another one for my yoga buddy! Highly recommend if you’re looking for a reliable, comfortable, and stylish yoga mat.",
          "Very high end and professional type of poly foam and material. Length and padding is great, easy to clean! The straps are simple loops and so easy to use to grab the rolled up mat. Compared to my old one, this is a major step up and fantastic",
          "Medium thickness, not too heavy, long enough for someone of average height 5.5’ with plenty of space to spare. Material is non stick on both sides. Used it on carpet and it did not slide. Love the lines to help hold positions better. Can’t speak to durability yet, but it seems well made.",
          "As you can see in the photo, the GAYO mat is slightly longer than my everyday yoga mat. I use this mat at home for stretching and strength training (barefoot). While it is 2mm thinner and lighter in weight than my OG mat, the smooth non-slip surface provides firm stability and soft cushioning. The alignment lines add a decorative touch and help to ensure that my body is in the proper position.The cons:1) My body sticking to the surface a little when I was sweating,2) The mat does have a faint rubber odor that is noticeable when I am laying with my face close to the mat,3) Can easily get scratched up by cats (see last photo). I use this mat around 1 hour per day. When not in use I keep it rolled up. I have noticed my cat stretch on the mat one time and as a result her claws left some lasting marks on the mat. They have stretched on my other yoga mat without the same effects. I assume because the surface on the GAYO mat is smooth it is more susceptible to this problem.",
