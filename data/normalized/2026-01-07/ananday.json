    "description": "Our bestselling Cork Yoga Mat — designed to support your body + our planet. Consciously made from plant-based, plastic-free materials — renewable cork + natural tree rubber. No plastic. No harsh chemicals. No toxins. 100% biodegradable.\nThe premium cork top layer releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet, making it even more slip-resistant with sweat — no towel necessary! And because cork is made from tree bark, it's naturally antimicrobial, preventing grime build-up and odors. The cork is fused with a cushioned tree rubber base for ultimate comfort to keep joints happy and healthy. Get ready for next level traction, support and stability, no matter how much you move or sweat.\nCork is one of the most earth-friendly materials available. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is stripped by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. A harvested cork tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated.\n \n\"Perfect Grip! Best Mat! I have been practicing yoga for almost 15 years, have tried Manduka, Liforme, Jade, and the Ananday is my favorite. I love that it is sustainable. Definitely recommend!\" — Maria\n\"Best. Mat. Ever. Totally non-slip for sweaty hot yoga, supports sensitive knees (I often have to use a blanket for the knees, but not with this mat), great thickness, beautiful, well-made, biodegradable... I've tried so many mats, and this one is undoubtedly my favorite. Love at first use. Using these mats for the rest of my life!\" — Anton\n\"Finally, a yoga mat where my hands don't slip! I've had a hard time finding a yoga mat where my sweaty hands don't slide but this cork yoga mat did the trick!\" — Nick\n1 mat = 1 tree planted 🌳 \n \n\nProduct details\n\n\n72\" x 24\" x 4mm | 5.4 lbs\nRenewable cork + natural tree rubber\n\nNatural, non-toxic, plastic-free\n\nNon-slip and sweat resistant\n\nRolls out flat and stays put\nUnmatched comfort and stability \n\nAntimicrobial — goodbye funky odors\nReversible — flip to rubber side for extra traction\nPlastic-free production and packaging\n\n100% biodegradable (learn how we pack)\n\n*Traction tip — spray water around hands and feet before practice for extra grip.\n*Advanced tip — if you're practicing inversions like forearm stand and handstand and would like to maximize traction, flip the mat over.\nWhy cork?\n\nCork releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet so it gets even more grippy with sweat — no towel necessary!\nMade from bark, which forms to protect trees, so it's naturally antimicrobial and stays earthy and fresh day in, day out.\n\nCork is one of the most earth-friendly materials. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is collected by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. Cork oak trees can live up to 200 years and a harvested tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated. Cork trees support some of the world’s most biodiverse forests.\nPracticing on materials from the earth is grounding. Our hands and feet have marma points (or energy pathways) that connect to the planet's subtle energy. Grounding balances biological rhythms, calms the nervous system, and helps our body heal.\n\nCare\n\n\nRoll your mat up loosely, careful to not fold or crease\n\n\nCork is naturally antimicrobial, preventing germ and odor buildup; for a deeper clean, simply spray with a natural mat cleaner and let dry\n\nCleaning recommended 1x weekly (more frequently with heated classes) to prevent body oils from building up and to keep the mat feeling fresh\nSince this mat is biodegradable and will (eventually) decompose, prolong its life by avoiding direct sunlight and extended water exposure\n\nWith extensive use, surface cracking may occur — this is purely visual and does not affect the feel or durability of the mat\n\n\nEnd of life\n\nCork and tree rubber are 100% biodegradable\nIf and when you're ready to part with your mat, consider a donation or drop it off at a recycling center\nOur packaging is also biodegradable and recyclable — learn how we pack\n\nHappiness guarantee\nWe're a small woman-owned brand committed to quality and sustainability. Our pieces are made from natural, sustainable, plant-based materials — no plastics, no toxins, 100% biodegradable and recyclable, including the packaging. We love our products and think you will too!
