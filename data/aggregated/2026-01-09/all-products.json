    "description": "Our bestselling Cork Yoga Mat — designed to support your body + our planet. Consciously made from plant-based, plastic-free materials — renewable cork + natural tree rubber. No plastic. No harsh chemicals. No toxins. 100% biodegradable.\nThe premium cork top layer releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet, making it even more slip-resistant with sweat — no towel necessary! And because cork is made from tree bark, it's naturally antimicrobial, preventing grime build-up and odors. The cork is fused with a cushioned tree rubber base for ultimate comfort to keep joints happy and healthy. Get ready for next level traction, support and stability, no matter how much you move or sweat.\nCork is one of the most earth-friendly materials available. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is stripped by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. A harvested cork tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated.\n \n\"Perfect Grip! Best Mat! I have been practicing yoga for almost 15 years, have tried Manduka, Liforme, Jade, and the Ananday is my favorite. I love that it is sustainable. Definitely recommend!\" — Maria\n\"Best. Mat. Ever. Totally non-slip for sweaty hot yoga, supports sensitive knees (I often have to use a blanket for the knees, but not with this mat), great thickness, beautiful, well-made, biodegradable... I've tried so many mats, and this one is undoubtedly my favorite. Love at first use. Using these mats for the rest of my life!\" — Anton\n\"Finally, a yoga mat where my hands don't slip! I've had a hard time finding a yoga mat where my sweaty hands don't slide but this cork yoga mat did the trick!\" — Nick\n1 mat = 1 tree planted 🌳 \n \n\nProduct details\n\n\n72\" x 24\" x 4mm | 5.4 lbs\nRenewable cork + natural tree rubber\n\nNatural, non-toxic, plastic-free\n\nNon-slip and sweat resistant\n\nRolls out flat and stays put\nUnmatched comfort and stability \n\nAntimicrobial — goodbye funky odors\nReversible — flip to rubber side for extra traction\nPlastic-free production and packaging\n\n100% biodegradable (learn how we pack)\n\n*Traction tip — spray water around hands and feet before practice for extra grip.\n*Advanced tip — if you're practicing inversions like forearm stand and handstand and would like to maximize traction, flip the mat over.\nWhy cork?\n\nCork releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet so it gets even more grippy with sweat — no towel necessary!\nMade from bark, which forms to protect trees, so it's naturally antimicrobial and stays earthy and fresh day in, day out.\n\nCork is one of the most earth-friendly materials. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is collected by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. Cork oak trees can live up to 200 years and a harvested tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated. Cork trees support some of the world’s most biodiverse forests.\nPracticing on materials from the earth is grounding.

    "description": "CONOCE A LA ARTISTA\nJESS GUZMAN, Colombiana, Arquitecta de profesión y artista de vocación. Me encuentro muy inclinado hacia la pintura; dibuja y pinta desde niña porque eso la hace sentir libre. Encuentra en lápiz y papel la manera de materializar sus pensamientos y emociones.\nSuele inspirarse en las formas de la naturaleza, y su estilo es una mezcla entre boceto, caricatura y abstracción.\nLa idea de dibujar para House of Mats la entusiasmó. Le encanta el concepto que Lucía, la dueña, tiene de la marca, pero más que eso, la historia que hay detrás y las razones que la motivaron.\nLas ilustraciones de House surgen del concepto mismo de la marca: los colores, las posturas, la conexión con la naturaleza, la energía del sol y del universo, dando como resultado una serie de imágenes sencillas, realizadas a mano con un trazo suave, la que comunican los conceptos básicos del yoga.\nNada es absoluto, todo es complementario, y de ese tránsito surge la idea.\nSobre el diseño: El elefante en general es un animal que se asemeja a los humanos, es sociable y disfruta de la unión familiar. Además, los elefantes crean fuertes lazos con su familia y amigos, hasta el punto de poder identificarse después de un tiempo sin verse.",

    "description": "The Perfect Mat For Hot Yoga!\n\nEco-Friendly: Made with sustainably harvested cork and natural rubber, rapidly renewable resources and contains no PVC*\n\nGreat Grip: Cork provides outstanding grip for hot yoga or other sweaty practices\n\nComfortable: Natural rubber base provides more comfort and resilience \n\n\nDimensions:  4.5mm thick, 24\" wide, and 72\" long and weight approximately 5 lbs\n\nBe The Change: Through our partnership with Trees for the Future, JADE PLANTS A TREE FOR EVERY MAT SOLD – with over TWO MILLION trees planted so far.\n\n\n*Made in Spain, the surface of the Jade Cork mat is harvested sustainably from cork trees in Portugal. Trees are not cut down, but after the tree is 25 years old, the bark of the tree is removed. This is repeated every 9 years, with the bark regenerating in the interim - absorbing additional CO2 during this process.\n*To Clean: Cork mats can be washed with soap and water then rinsed with water. Hang inside to dry.  Store rolled with cork side out.\n*Please note that colors on the screen are approximations and do not match the mats exactly; if you would like to know the exact color of our mats, please visit one of our retailers or email us to request a free sample swatch.",

Made from sustainably sourced natural rubber and PVC-free materials, this Yoga mat is truly Planet friendly and body-kind. \nDesigned to be longer and wider than standard Yoga mats, it gives you more space to move freely, with the perfect balance of firm stability and soft cushioning for every pose.\nAs part of Liforme’s commitment to conservation, 3% of Liforme.com sales of the Year of the Tiger Yoga Mat will be donated to WWF to support their conservation and campaigning work which is helping to bring our world back to life. WWF-UK is a registered charity in England and Wales 1081247 and in Scotland SC039593 and a company limited by guarantee registered in England and Wales 4016725. \nIncludes a complimentary Yoga Mat bag for easy carrying and storage.",

Because of this, if you are warm/sweaty at all, the mat will feel slippery, so we always recommend pairing it with one of our hand towels to absorb moisture and provide extra traction or to apply our Yoga Grip Gel during your practice. If you're practicing hot yoga, we recommend a mat towel for full mat coverage. For towel guidance read our Guide to Yoga Towels.",

Because of this, if you are warm/sweaty at all, the mat will feel slippery, so we always recommend pairing it with one of our hand towels to absorb moisture and provide extra traction or to apply our Yoga Grip Gel during your practice. If you're practicing hot yoga, we recommend a mat towel for full mat coverage. For towel guidance read our Guide to Yoga Towels.",

That extra 2mm thickness ensures the best combo of comfort and stability. Need more softness? We include a soft large microfiber yoga towel for you to use on top!\n\nA SAFER TRAINING MAT – Goodbye smelly, unhealthy PVC. And hello odorless, non-toxic 16P-ECO!

I chose the elegant butterfly Koi, known for their long, flowing fins and tails, adding a touch of beauty and movement to the design. Complementing the koi, water lettuce has been included for its decorative appeal, enhancing the overall aesthetic and staying true to the initial concept. In Japanese culture, Koi fish symbolize luck and prosperity, while the waterlilies, akin to lotuses, represent rebirth and resurrection.\" \nThis artwork is brought to you by Yohanes Ragil, an Illustrator/Graphic Designer based in Bali, Indonesia. His works are usually inspired by nature and cultures (especially Southeast Asian) with a style inspired by lino-cut technique in a monochromatic palette. \nFree gift : Carry strap is included",

    "description": "This artwork is created by Emma Hall : \"I was really inspired by retro floral patterns from the 60s and 70s that use this clearly hand-drawn element to create a more fun and organic pattern. My aim was to infuse these patterns with modern colors and details to give them a more modern edge. To create the design I use purely hand-drawings which are then scanned and vectorised to allow resizing and colouring.\"Emma is a British designer from Cambridge. Her biggest joy in her work is colour. The process involved usually centres around mixing analogue and digital methods. Subjects are generally drawn from nature, such as, imagined or real African landscapes, wildflowers and animals. Her travels growing up and Mozambican heritage may have also contributed to these interests. This design is featured on a premium vegan suede yoga mat, combining Emma's vibrant artistry with eco-conscious functionality.\nFree gift : Carry strap is included\nFeatured on The Yoga Nomads",

    "description": "THE CORK MAT\n\nUnlike most of our competition, our Cork Mat is made with a 100% natural rubber base layer topped with a renewable, sustainable cork top layer.\nWhile natural cork provides superior wet and dry grip, it is ideal in heated and hot yoga classes because as temperatures rise, cork begins to loosen and becomes softer & easier to grip. It's also moisture-activated - becoming grippier as it gets wet. Truly nature's best solution for towel-free traction. Cork is also closed-cell and naturally anti-microbial, sealing out moisture & resisting odor and bacteria from sweat.\nOur natural rubber base layer offers a unique springy ride that cushions and protects joints, while also remaining stable and supportive in any pose. Stays put on the floor better than foam base layers and provides denser cushioning.\nThe stunning, symmetrical pattern helps guide alignment, and is printed using a non-fade water-based ink.\nNote:  The foldable 1.5mm option is excellent for yogis on the go, and also provides an excellent non-slip, natural \"topper\" to other mats.\n\n\n\n PRO TIP\n\nFor optimal grip, lightly spritz your mat with water before practice.\n\n\n\n DURABLE\n\nSupports any practice from a high intensity workout to a gentle flow. Suitable for shoes.\n\n\n\n EARTH CONSCIOUS\n\n \n\nSustainable, renewable cork top layer made from the outer layer of bark from the cork oak tree. (Cork trees are the only tree in the world that regenerate stripped bark.)\nBase layer is made with natural, non-Amazonian harvested tree rubber.\nAll of our beautiful designs are printed with water-based inks.\nPhthalate, silicone and toxin-fee.\n\n\n\n\n CARE INSTRUCTIONS\n\nTo clean, wipe with a soft towel dampened with soap and water; lay flat or hang to air dry.\nRoll with the colored/designed side on the outside.\n\n\n\n DIMENSIONS\n\n70\"(178 cm) long x 24\"(61 cm) wide\n1.5mm thick = 3.5 lb (1.6 kg)\nIncludes carrying strap",

    "description": "Sustainability innovation at its best - a yoga mat that actually helps to clean the environment!\nThe Yogamatters Aqua Evolve yoga mat is made from a unique combination of EVA foam and algae from lakes and ponds. \nAlgae blooms pose a major problem for communities around the world causing eco-systems to become out of balance. They are caused by factors such as climate change, water pollution from agriculture, industry and society.\nOur partners at BLOOM have found an innovative way of helping the environment by turning algae blooms into eco-foams for use in products. \nDuring algae harvesting, the algae is separated from the water and the clean, filtered and oxygenated water is returned back into the environment. Helping to restore the eco-system. Algae also absorbs and traps CO2 from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. When the algae is harvested, the CO2 comes along with it, which means cleaner air too!\nFor every mat, 64 litres of cleaned water are returned to the local habitat as well as 40 cubic metres of clean air. \n\nUses reclaimed/recycled materials certified by the Global Recycling Standard (GRS) \nEco-friendly\nVegan\nLightweight and portable at 750 grams\nFree from latex, PVC, toxic chemicals and dyes\n5mm thickness for super cushioning\nMade in Spain\n\nPlease keep the mat out of direct sunlight and hot places. Store in a cool, dry place.",

With a lifetime guarantee, the Manduka PRO Mat will revolutionise your practice for years to come.\n• closed-cell surface to keep moisture and sweat from seeping into the mat and breeding bacteria and proprietary dot pattern bottom to resist sliding• high-density cushion for unparalleled experience, joint protection, and versatility on any surface (carpet, cement, hardwood floors) • fabric-like surface finish for optimal movement between poses • sustainable engineering ensures high quality material will not peel, flake or fade • designed to last a lifetime (or two), Manduka PRO series yoga mats are 100% latex free and curb the amount of PVC mats that enter landfills every year \n \nTo Store: Roll Manduka PRO mats with the top side (fabric-finish) facing outwards. This keeps the corners of the mat flat when practising.\nTo Break In: The surface texture of Manduka PRO mats improves with use. The best way to break in your mat is practise, practise, practise, but if you want to speed things up a little, try a simple salt scrub, or cleaning your mat thoroughly before and after every practice with a non-scratch sponge and a mat wash (or a homemade mixture of organic detergent and water).",

    "description": "Built sustainably for the mindful yogi, the updated Manduka eKO® lite 4mm yoga mat provides an improved Catch-Grip™ surface texture for traction in wet and dry conditions, combined with Responsive Ride™ layer for a cushioned, springy ride. Sustainably manufactured from recycled non-Amazon harvested tree rubber, the eKO lite supports both your practice and our planet.\nAll Manduka eKO® Series yoga mats have a closed-cell surface, which will never absorb moisture. Because of this, if you are warm or sweaty, the yoga mat will feel slippery, so we always recommend pairing it with a hand towel to absorb moisture and provide extra traction or to apply Yoga Grip Gel during your practice. If you're practicing hot yoga, we recommend a mat towel for full mat coverage.",

    "description": "The ecoYoga biodegradable yoga mat is both practical and ethical for beginners and experienced students alike. With a pure rubber underside for a firm grip on the floor, this eco-friendly yoga mat boasts a surface layer blend of natural hessian/jute fabric and a unique 100% natural rubber compound which provides an excellent non slip surface for your yoga practice.\n\nmade in the UK\nsustainable plant-based materials\nsuitable for vegans\n100% natural rubber (contains latex)\nbiodegradable\nexcellent grip / non-slip\n\nPlease note that the weave of the jute is such that some loose threads and nubs are normal. There is also a 10% allowance on the jute exposure as 100% natural raw materials will not always be 100% consistent. Due to the nature of the materials, if the mat is subject to very heavy use, it may degrade quicker than some other less eco-friendly mats. Colours can have slight variations. Also, 100% natural rubber has a tendency to bloom which can appear on the surface as a mild dusty coating - it can be wiped off with water.",

    "description": "The Jade Voyager Mat is the most portable mat that Jade Yoga offers, made specifically to go with you everywhere and anywhere. This extra thin yoga mat folds up to about the size of a yoga block, allowing it to fit perfectly into your suitcase or backpack. The Jade Yoga Voyager Mat has only one side, the other \"net\"-side is used for stability and grip to the floor. \n\nthe best choice if you have a limited amount of storage space or will be using it over another mat\ngreat grip - open cell natural rubber provides optimum grip\ncomfortable - natural rubber has more resilience and cushion\neco-Friendly - made in the US with natural rubber, a renewable resource and contains no synthetic plastics.\nthrough its partnership with Trees for the Future, JadeYoga plants a Tree with every mat sold\n\nWhile the Voyager is ideal for those that have to travel light and/or have limited storage space, it is not the best option for daily usage, as its portability impacts overall durability. Creases are a natural consequence of folding the Jade Yoga Voyager Mat - effects will be minimised by keeping your mat rolled when not travelling. Please note that the reinforcing scrim which is hidden inside the other Jade mats is visible on the bottom of the Voyager mat.\nAlthough Jade mats are 99% latex free, as they are from rubber trees, there may be trace amounts of latex proteins in the mats so we recommend persons with latex allergies avoid contact with these mats.\nDo not leave exposed to direct sunlight.",

    "description": "The Cork Yoga Mat is the most sustainable choice within yoga mats.\nCork is lightweight, allowing for more efficient shipping to the factory. The yoga mat cork is supported by a base of natural non-slip rubber from Vietnam. Only water-based inks are used for the prints, leaving you with a fully sustainable and beautiful piece of art. Cork is antimicrobial, meaning you don’t need harmful chemicals to clean your collection. Organic soap and water are sufficient and if you get any major stains, you can actually file down the cork a bit and avoid cleaners altogether!\n\nDesigned to love the earth and your practice\nNon-slip grip that improves with sweat\nHigh-density cushion for support\nDurable: Premium quality for the most rigorous studio conditions or at home\nEco-friendly: biodegradable natural cork and rubber with water-based inks\nFree from silicone, pvc, and phthalates\nEasy to Clean: antimicrobial cork\nIncludes carrying strap\n\n\nCork trees grow around the Mediterranean naturally and on farms. The mat cork is sourced and certified from tree farms in Portugal. The bark of the cork tree can be harvested every 9-10 years during its 200-year life span. The tree is not harmed during the process; it actually allows for greater absorption of CO2 while the bark regrows.\nIf a tree does reach its end life, two new saplings are planted in its place thus ensuring the cork forest continues to flourish and renew. The harvested cork bark is shredded to a pulp and pressed into long sheets to be used in products. Any leftover cork dust is used to fuel the mills.\nIf you no longer need your products, cork is compostable. Better yet, you can find a local agency to upcycle your cork or find DIY inspiration online to upcycle your cork.",

    "description": "Back to the roots - With Jade's organic cotton Mysore yoga rugs you can feel closer to the traditional roots of Yoga. They're perfect for all kinds of yoga, including Ashtanga, outdoor classes, and beach yoga. \nJade`s Mysore rugs are handwoven by rural artisans in India, preserving a tradition and art form and providing a livelihood for weavers. Weaving is a traditional way of life for many people in this region, which has experienced an enormous decline in recent years due to increasing industrialization. These rugs support the traditional weavers and enable them to use their skills to support their families as well as to keep this tradition alive.\nThey are made with organic cotton and all natural vegetable dyes made from herbs including indigo, cumin and turmeric. The herbal dyes are specially made in small batches in order to get the most color and benefits from the herbs.\nThese rugs are lightweight at only 1.13kg and can easily be taken outdoors to the park or the beach. They are also machine washable with cold water, making them easy to care for. (note that rugs may shrink slightly in the wash). Wash colours separately and hang to air dry (will shrink if put in a dryer).\nWhen using on hard surfaces such as hardwood, laminate and tile floors, please use on top of your Jade mat (natural rubber mats) or other non-slip underlay to prevent slipping.\nWith the purchase of each rug, Jade provides a week of hot lunches to a child in need in India.\nMeasurements:Thickness: 1/8\" (3mm)Width: 27\" (68.6cm)Length: 72\" (183cm)Weight: 1.1kg",

    "description": "The Cork Yoga Mat is the most sustainable choice within yoga mats.\nCork is lightweight, allowing for more efficient shipping to the factory. The yoga mat cork is supported by a base of natural non-slip rubber from Vietnam. Only water-based inks are used for the prints, leaving you with a fully sustainable and beautiful piece of art. Cork is antimicrobial, meaning you don’t need harmful chemicals to clean your collection. Organic soap and water are sufficient and if you get any major stains, you can actually file down the cork a bit and avoid cleaners altogether!\n\nDesigned to love the earth and your practice.\nNon-slip grip that improves with sweat\nSymmetrical design aids alignment\nHigh-density cushion for support\nDurable: Premium quality for the most rigorous studio conditions or at home\nEco-friendly: biodegradable natural cork and rubber with water-based inks.\nFree from silicone, pvc, and phthalates\nEasy to Clean: antimicrobial cork\nIncludes carrying strap\n\nCork trees grow around the Mediterranean naturally and on farms. The mat cork is sourced and certified from tree farms in Portugal. The bark of the cork tree can be harvested every 9-10 years during its 200-year life span. The tree is not harmed during the process; it actually allows for greater absorption of CO2 while the bark regrows.\nIf a tree does reach its end life, two new saplings are planted in its place thus ensuring the cork forest continues to flourish and renew. The harvested cork bark is shredded to a pulp and pressed into long sheets to be used in products. Any leftover cork dust is used to fuel the mills.\nIf you no longer need your products, cork is compostable.
