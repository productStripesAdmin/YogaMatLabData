    "description": "Our bestselling Cork Yoga Mat — designed to support your body + our planet. Consciously made from plant-based, plastic-free materials — renewable cork + natural tree rubber. No plastic. No harsh chemicals. No toxins. 100% biodegradable.\nThe premium cork top layer releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet, making it even more slip-resistant with sweat — no towel necessary! And because cork is made from tree bark, it's naturally antimicrobial, preventing grime build-up and odors. The cork is fused with a cushioned tree rubber base for ultimate comfort to keep joints happy and healthy. Get ready for next level traction, support and stability, no matter how much you move or sweat.\nCork is one of the most earth-friendly materials available. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is stripped by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. A harvested cork tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated.\n \n\"Perfect Grip! Best Mat! I have been practicing yoga for almost 15 years, have tried Manduka, Liforme, Jade, and the Ananday is my favorite. I love that it is sustainable. Definitely recommend!\" — Maria\n\"Best. Mat. Ever. Totally non-slip for sweaty hot yoga, supports sensitive knees (I often have to use a blanket for the knees, but not with this mat), great thickness, beautiful, well-made, biodegradable... I've tried so many mats, and this one is undoubtedly my favorite. Love at first use. Using these mats for the rest of my life!\" — Anton\n\"Finally, a yoga mat where my hands don't slip! I've had a hard time finding a yoga mat where my sweaty hands don't slide but this cork yoga mat did the trick!\" — Nick\n1 mat = 1 tree planted 🌳 \n \n\nProduct details\n\n\n72\" x 24\" x 4mm | 5.4 lbs\nRenewable cork + natural tree rubber\n\nNatural, non-toxic, plastic-free\n\nNon-slip and sweat resistant\n\nRolls out flat and stays put\nUnmatched comfort and stability \n\nAntimicrobial — goodbye funky odors\nReversible — flip to rubber side for extra traction\nPlastic-free production and packaging\n\n100% biodegradable (learn how we pack)\n\n*Traction tip — spray water around hands and feet before practice for extra grip.\n*Advanced tip — if you're practicing inversions like forearm stand and handstand and would like to maximize traction, flip the mat over.\nWhy cork?\n\nCork releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet so it gets even more grippy with sweat — no towel necessary!\nMade from bark, which forms to protect trees, so it's naturally antimicrobial and stays earthy and fresh day in, day out.\n\nCork is one of the most earth-friendly materials. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is collected by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. Cork oak trees can live up to 200 years and a harvested tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated. Cork trees support some of the world’s most biodiverse forests.\nPracticing on materials from the earth is grounding. Our hands and feet have marma points (or energy pathways) that connect to the planet's subtle energy. Grounding balances biological rhythms, calms the nervous system, and helps our body heal.\n\nCare\n\n\nRoll your mat up loosely, careful to not fold or crease\n\n\nCork is naturally antimicrobial, preventing germ and odor buildup; for a deeper clean, simply spray with a natural mat cleaner and let dry\n\nCleaning recommended 1x weekly (more frequently with heated classes) to prevent body oils from building up and to keep the mat feeling fresh\nSince this mat is biodegradable and will (eventually) decompose, prolong its life by avoiding direct sunlight and extended water exposure\n\nWith extensive use, surface cracking may occur — this is purely visual and does not affect the feel or durability of the mat\n\n\nEnd of life\n\nCork and tree rubber are 100% biodegradable\nIf and when you're ready to part with your mat, consider a donation or drop it off at a recycling center\nOur packaging is also biodegradable and recyclable — learn how we pack\n\nHappiness guarantee\nWe're a small woman-owned brand committed to quality and sustainability. Our pieces are made from natural, sustainable, plant-based materials — no plastics, no toxins, 100% biodegradable and recyclable, including the packaging. We love our products and think you will too!

Me encuentro muy inclinado hacia la pintura; dibuja y pinta desde niña porque eso la hace sentir libre. Encuentra en lápiz y papel la manera de materializar sus pensamientos y emociones.\nSuele inspirarse en las formas de la naturaleza, y su estilo es una mezcla entre boceto, caricatura y abstracción.\nLa idea de dibujar para House of Mats la entusiasmó. Le encanta el concepto que Lucía, la dueña, tiene de la marca, pero más que eso, la historia que hay detrás y las razones que la motivaron.\nLas ilustraciones de House surgen del concepto mismo de la marca: los colores, las posturas, la conexión con la naturaleza, la energía del sol y del universo, dando como resultado una serie de imágenes sencillas, realizadas a mano con un trazo suave, la que comunican los conceptos básicos del yoga.\nNada es absoluto, todo es complementario, y de ese tránsito surge la idea.\nSobre el diseño: El elefante en general es un animal que se asemeja a los humanos, es sociable y disfruta de la unión familiar. Además, los elefantes crean fuertes lazos con su familia y amigos, hasta el punto de poder identificarse después de un tiempo sin verse.",

    "description": "Sustainability innovation at its best - a yoga mat that actually helps to clean the environment!\nThe Yogamatters Aqua Evolve yoga mat is made from a unique combination of EVA foam and algae from lakes and ponds. \nAlgae blooms pose a major problem for communities around the world causing eco-systems to become out of balance. They are caused by factors such as climate change, water pollution from agriculture, industry and society.\nOur partners at BLOOM have found an innovative way of helping the environment by turning algae blooms into eco-foams for use in products. \nDuring algae harvesting, the algae is separated from the water and the clean, filtered and oxygenated water is returned back into the environment. Helping to restore the eco-system. Algae also absorbs and traps CO2 from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. When the algae is harvested, the CO2 comes along with it, which means cleaner air too!\nFor every mat, 64 litres of cleaned water are returned to the local habitat as well as 40 cubic metres of clean air. \n\nUses reclaimed/recycled materials certified by the Global Recycling Standard (GRS) \nEco-friendly\nVegan\nLightweight and portable at 750 grams\nFree from latex, PVC, toxic chemicals and dyes\n5mm thickness for super cushioning\nMade in Spain\n\nPlease keep the mat out of direct sunlight and hot places. Store in a cool, dry place.",

Creases are a natural consequence of folding the Jade Yoga Voyager Mat - effects will be minimised by keeping your mat rolled when not travelling. Please note that the reinforcing scrim which is hidden inside the other Jade mats is visible on the bottom of the Voyager mat.\nAlthough Jade mats are 99% latex free, as they are from rubber trees, there may be trace amounts of latex proteins in the mats so we recommend persons with latex allergies avoid contact with these mats.\nDo not leave exposed to direct sunlight.",

    "description": "The Cork Yoga Mat is the most sustainable choice within yoga mats.\nCork is lightweight, allowing for more efficient shipping to the factory. The yoga mat cork is supported by a base of natural non-slip rubber from Vietnam. Only water-based inks are used for the prints, leaving you with a fully sustainable and beautiful piece of art. Cork is antimicrobial, meaning you don’t need harmful chemicals to clean your collection. Organic soap and water are sufficient and if you get any major stains, you can actually file down the cork a bit and avoid cleaners altogether!\n\nDesigned to love the earth and your practice\nNon-slip grip that improves with sweat\nHigh-density cushion for support\nDurable: Premium quality for the most rigorous studio conditions or at home\nEco-friendly: biodegradable natural cork and rubber with water-based inks\nFree from silicone, pvc, and phthalates\nEasy to Clean: antimicrobial cork\nIncludes carrying strap\n\n\nCork trees grow around the Mediterranean naturally and on farms. The mat cork is sourced and certified from tree farms in Portugal. The bark of the cork tree can be harvested every 9-10 years during its 200-year life span. The tree is not harmed during the process; it actually allows for greater absorption of CO2 while the bark regrows.\nIf a tree does reach its end life, two new saplings are planted in its place thus ensuring the cork forest continues to flourish and renew. The harvested cork bark is shredded to a pulp and pressed into long sheets to be used in products. Any leftover cork dust is used to fuel the mills.\nIf you no longer need your products, cork is compostable. Better yet, you can find a local agency to upcycle your cork or find DIY inspiration online to upcycle your cork.",

    "description": "Back to the roots - With Jade's organic cotton Mysore yoga rugs you can feel closer to the traditional roots of Yoga. They're perfect for all kinds of yoga, including Ashtanga, outdoor classes, and beach yoga. \nJade`s Mysore rugs are handwoven by rural artisans in India, preserving a tradition and art form and providing a livelihood for weavers. Weaving is a traditional way of life for many people in this region, which has experienced an enormous decline in recent years due to increasing industrialization. These rugs support the traditional weavers and enable them to use their skills to support their families as well as to keep this tradition alive.\nThey are made with organic cotton and all natural vegetable dyes made from herbs including indigo, cumin and turmeric. The herbal dyes are specially made in small batches in order to get the most color and benefits from the herbs.\nThese rugs are lightweight at only 1.13kg and can easily be taken outdoors to the park or the beach. They are also machine washable with cold water, making them easy to care for. (note that rugs may shrink slightly in the wash). Wash colours separately and hang to air dry (will shrink if put in a dryer).\nWhen using on hard surfaces such as hardwood, laminate and tile floors, please use on top of your Jade mat (natural rubber mats) or other non-slip underlay to prevent slipping.\nWith the purchase of each rug, Jade provides a week of hot lunches to a child in need in India.\nMeasurements:Thickness: 1/8\" (3mm)Width: 27\" (68.6cm)Length: 72\" (183cm)Weight: 1.1kg",

    "description": "The Cork Yoga Mat is the most sustainable choice within yoga mats.\nCork is lightweight, allowing for more efficient shipping to the factory. The yoga mat cork is supported by a base of natural non-slip rubber from Vietnam. Only water-based inks are used for the prints, leaving you with a fully sustainable and beautiful piece of art. Cork is antimicrobial, meaning you don’t need harmful chemicals to clean your collection. Organic soap and water are sufficient and if you get any major stains, you can actually file down the cork a bit and avoid cleaners altogether!\n\nDesigned to love the earth and your practice.\nNon-slip grip that improves with sweat\nSymmetrical design aids alignment\nHigh-density cushion for support\nDurable: Premium quality for the most rigorous studio conditions or at home\nEco-friendly: biodegradable natural cork and rubber with water-based inks.\nFree from silicone, pvc, and phthalates\nEasy to Clean: antimicrobial cork\nIncludes carrying strap\n\nCork trees grow around the Mediterranean naturally and on farms. The mat cork is sourced and certified from tree farms in Portugal. The bark of the cork tree can be harvested every 9-10 years during its 200-year life span. The tree is not harmed during the process; it actually allows for greater absorption of CO2 while the bark regrows.\nIf a tree does reach its end life, two new saplings are planted in its place thus ensuring the cork forest continues to flourish and renew. The harvested cork bark is shredded to a pulp and pressed into long sheets to be used in products. Any leftover cork dust is used to fuel the mills.\nIf you no longer need your products, cork is compostable. Better yet, you can find a local agency to upcycle your cork or find DIY inspiration online to upcycle your cork.",
