ananday-ananday-cork-yoga-mat,Ananday Cork Yoga Mat,ananday,"Our bestselling Cork Yoga Mat — designed to support your body + our planet. Consciously made from plant-based, plastic-free materials — renewable cork + natural tree rubber. No plastic. No harsh chemicals. No toxins. 100% biodegradable.
The premium cork top layer releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet, making it even more slip-resistant with sweat — no towel necessary! And because cork is made from tree bark, it's naturally antimicrobial, preventing grime build-up and odors. The cork is fused with a cushioned tree rubber base for ultimate comfort to keep joints happy and healthy. Get ready for next level traction, support and stability, no matter how much you move or sweat.
Cork is one of the most earth-friendly materials available. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is stripped by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. A harvested cork tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated.
 
""Perfect Grip! Best Mat! I have been practicing yoga for almost 15 years, have tried Manduka, Liforme, Jade, and the Ananday is my favorite. I love that it is sustainable. Definitely recommend!"" — Maria
""Best. Mat. Ever. Totally non-slip for sweaty hot yoga, supports sensitive knees (I often have to use a blanket for the knees, but not with this mat), great thickness, beautiful, well-made, biodegradable... I've tried so many mats, and this one is undoubtedly my favorite. Love at first use. Using these mats for the rest of my life!"" — Anton
""Finally, a yoga mat where my hands don't slip! I've had a hard time finding a yoga mat where my sweaty hands don't slide but this cork yoga mat did the trick!"" — Nick

Why cork?

Cork releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet so it gets even more grippy with sweat — no towel necessary!
Made from bark, which forms to protect trees, so it's naturally antimicrobial and stays earthy and fresh day in, day out.

Cork is one of the most earth-friendly materials. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is collected by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. Cork oak trees can live up to 200 years and a harvested tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated. Cork trees support some of the world’s most biodiverse forests.
Practicing on materials from the earth is grounding. Our hands and feet have marma points (or energy pathways) that connect to the planet's subtle energy. Grounding balances biological rhythms, calms the nervous system, and helps our body heal.

Care


Roll your mat up loosely, careful to not fold or crease


Cork is naturally antimicrobial, preventing germ and odor buildup; for a deeper clean, simply spray with a natural mat cleaner and let dry

Cleaning recommended 1x weekly (more frequently with heated classes) to prevent body oils from building up and to keep the mat feeling fresh
Since this mat is biodegradable and will (eventually) decompose, prolong its life by avoiding direct sunlight and extended water exposure

With extensive use, surface cracking may occur — this is purely visual and does not affect the feel or durability of the mat


End of life

Cork and tree rubber are 100% biodegradable
If and when you're ready to part with your mat, consider a donation or drop it off at a recycling center

houseofmats-familia,Africa by Jess Guzman Yoga mat - Art Collection - 4mm,houseofmats,"CONOCE A LA ARTISTA
JESS GUZMAN, Colombiana, Arquitecta de profesión y artista de vocación. Me encuentro muy inclinado hacia la pintura; dibuja y pinta desde niña porque eso la hace sentir libre. Encuentra en lápiz y papel la manera de materializar sus pensamientos y emociones.
Suele inspirarse en las formas de la naturaleza, y su estilo es una mezcla entre boceto, caricatura y abstracción.
La idea de dibujar para House of Mats la entusiasmó. Le encanta el concepto que Lucía, la dueña, tiene de la marca, pero más que eso, la historia que hay detrás y las razones que la motivaron.
Las ilustraciones de House surgen del concepto mismo de la marca: los colores, las posturas, la conexión con la naturaleza, la energía del sol y del universo, dando como resultado una serie de imágenes sencillas, realizadas a mano con un trazo suave, la que comunican los conceptos básicos del yoga.
Nada es absoluto, todo es complementario, y de ese tránsito surge la idea.

Made by local artisans in India: Jade's Darbha grass meditation mats are handwoven by rural artisans, preserving a tradition and art form and providing a livelihood for weavers.

These rugs support the traditional weavers and allow them to use their skills to support their families. For many of them, this is the only job they have ever had and making these rugs allows them to keep this tradition alive. Please click here to hear our weaver talk about his work.

In Japanese culture, Koi fish symbolize luck and prosperity, while the waterlilies, akin to lotuses, represent rebirth and resurrection.""

thesatoriconcept-vegan-suede-yoga-mat-forest,Yoga Mat Forest Design,thesatoriconcept,"This artwork is created by Emma Hall : ""I was really inspired by retro floral patterns from the 60s and 70s that use this clearly hand-drawn element to create a more fun and organic pattern. My aim was to infuse these patterns with modern colors and details to give them a more modern edge. To create the design I use purely hand-drawings which are then scanned and vectorised to allow resizing and colouring.""Emma is a British designer from Cambridge. Her biggest joy in her work is colour. The process involved usually centres around mixing analogue and digital methods. Subjects are generally drawn from nature, such as, imagined or real African landscapes, wildflowers and animals. Her travels growing up and Mozambican heritage may have also contributed to these interests. This design is featured on a premium vegan suede yoga mat, combining Emma's vibrant artistry with eco-conscious functionality.

yogadesignlab-cork-yoga-mat-1-5mm-mandala-black,Travel Cork Yoga Mat - Mandala Black,yogadesignlab,"THE CORK MAT

Unlike most of our competition, our Cork Mat is made with a 100% natural rubber base layer topped with a renewable, sustainable cork top layer.
While natural cork provides superior wet and dry grip, it is ideal in heated and hot yoga classes because as temperatures rise, cork begins to loosen and becomes softer & easier to grip. It's also moisture-activated - becoming grippier as it gets wet. Truly nature's best solution for towel-free traction. Cork is also closed-cell and naturally anti-microbial, sealing out moisture & resisting odor and bacteria from sweat.
Our natural rubber base layer offers a unique springy ride that cushions and protects joints, while also remaining stable and supportive in any pose. Stays put on the floor better than foam base layers and provides denser cushioning.
The stunning, symmetrical pattern helps guide alignment, and is printed using a non-fade water-based ink.
Note:  The foldable 1.5mm option is excellent for yogis on the go, and also provides an excellent non-slip, natural ""topper"" to other mats.



 PRO TIP

For optimal grip, lightly spritz your mat with water before practice.



 DURABLE

Supports any practice from a high intensity workout to a gentle flow. Suitable for shoes.



 EARTH CONSCIOUS

 

Sustainable, renewable cork top layer made from the outer layer of bark from the cork oak tree. (Cork trees are the only tree in the world that regenerate stripped bark.)
Base layer is made with natural, non-Amazonian harvested tree rubber.
All of our beautiful designs are printed with water-based inks.
Phthalate, silicone and toxin-fee.




 CARE INSTRUCTIONS

To clean, wipe with a soft towel dampened with soap and water; lay flat or hang to air dry.
Roll with the colored/designed side on the outside.

yogamatters-yogamatters-aqua-evolve-yoga-mat,Yogamatters Aqua Evolve Yoga Mat,yogamatters,"Sustainability innovation at its best - a yoga mat that actually helps to clean the environment!
The Yogamatters Aqua Evolve yoga mat is made from a unique combination of EVA foam and algae from lakes and ponds. 
Algae blooms pose a major problem for communities around the world causing eco-systems to become out of balance. They are caused by factors such as climate change, water pollution from agriculture, industry and society.
Our partners at BLOOM have found an innovative way of helping the environment by turning algae blooms into eco-foams for use in products. 
During algae harvesting, the algae is separated from the water and the clean, filtered and oxygenated water is returned back into the environment. Helping to restore the eco-system. Algae also absorbs and traps CO2 from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. When the algae is harvested, the CO2 comes along with it, which means cleaner air too!
For every mat, 64 litres of cleaned water are returned to the local habitat as well as 40 cubic metres of clean air.

yogamatters-yoga-design-lab-cork-mat-3-5mm-nature-balance,Yoga Design Lab Cork Mat 3.5mm - Natural Balance,yogamatters,"The Cork Yoga Mat is the most sustainable choice within yoga mats.
Cork is lightweight, allowing for more efficient shipping to the factory. The yoga mat cork is supported by a base of natural non-slip rubber from Vietnam. Only water-based inks are used for the prints, leaving you with a fully sustainable and beautiful piece of art. Cork is antimicrobial, meaning you don’t need harmful chemicals to clean your collection. Organic soap and water are sufficient and if you get any major stains, you can actually file down the cork a bit and avoid cleaners altogether!

Designed to love the earth and your practice
Non-slip grip that improves with sweat
High-density cushion for support
Durable: Premium quality for the most rigorous studio conditions or at home
Eco-friendly: biodegradable natural cork and rubber with water-based inks
Free from silicone, pvc, and phthalates
Easy to Clean: antimicrobial cork
Includes carrying strap


Cork trees grow around the Mediterranean naturally and on farms. The mat cork is sourced and certified from tree farms in Portugal. The bark of the cork tree can be harvested every 9-10 years during its 200-year life span. The tree is not harmed during the process; it actually allows for greater absorption of CO2 while the bark regrows.
If a tree does reach its end life, two new saplings are planted in its place thus ensuring the cork forest continues to flourish and renew. The harvested cork bark is shredded to a pulp and pressed into long sheets to be used in products. Any leftover cork dust is used to fuel the mills.
If you no longer need your products, cork is compostable. Better yet, you can find a local agency to upcycle your cork or find DIY inspiration online to upcycle your cork.",110,110,USD,3.5,mm,3.5mm,178,cm,178cm x 61cm ,61,cm,178cm x 61cm ,1.6,kg,1.6kg,Cork,Grippy,Eco-Friendly; Non-Slip; Lightweight; Antimicrobial; Premium,,1,true,15069151461761,yoga-design-lab-cork-mat-3-5mm-nature-balance,YDLAB01,Mat,Collection: eco-yoga-mats; Collection: mats-and-bags; Collection: yoga-mats; KeyFeatures: sustainable-materials; Manufacturer: yoga-design-lab; ProductSubCategory: mat; TaxClass: taxable-goods; Thickness: 3-5mm,2025-05-07T15:02:48+01:00,2025-05-16T12:23:15+01:00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/7259/1939/files/Yoga-Design-Lab-Cork-Mat-3.5mm-Nature-Balance.jpg?v=1747389116

yogamatters-jade-yoga-organic-cotton-mysore-yoga-rug,Jade Yoga Organic Cotton Mysore Yoga Rug,yogamatters,"Back to the roots - With Jade's organic cotton Mysore yoga rugs you can feel closer to the traditional roots of Yoga. They're perfect for all kinds of yoga, including Ashtanga, outdoor classes, and beach yoga. 
Jade`s Mysore rugs are handwoven by rural artisans in India, preserving a tradition and art form and providing a livelihood for weavers. Weaving is a traditional way of life for many people in this region, which has experienced an enormous decline in recent years due to increasing industrialization. These rugs support the traditional weavers and enable them to use their skills to support their families as well as to keep this tradition alive.
They are made with organic cotton and all natural vegetable dyes made from herbs including indigo, cumin and turmeric. The herbal dyes are specially made in small batches in order to get the most color and benefits from the herbs.
These rugs are lightweight at only 1.13kg and can easily be taken outdoors to the park or the beach. They are also machine washable with cold water, making them easy to care for. (note that rugs may shrink slightly in the wash). Wash colours separately and hang to air dry (will shrink if put in a dryer).
When using on hard surfaces such as hardwood, laminate and tile floors, please use on top of your Jade mat (natural rubber mats) or other non-slip underlay to prevent slipping.
With the purchase of each rug, Jade provides a week of hot lunches to a child in need in India.

Cork is lightweight, allowing for more efficient shipping to the factory. The yoga mat cork is supported by a base of natural non-slip rubber from Vietnam. Only water-based inks are used for the prints, leaving you with a fully sustainable and beautiful piece of art. Cork is antimicrobial, meaning you don’t need harmful chemicals to clean your collection. Organic soap and water are sufficient and if you get any major stains, you can actually file down the cork a bit and avoid cleaners altogether!

Cork trees grow around the Mediterranean naturally and on farms. The mat cork is sourced and certified from tree farms in Portugal. The bark of the cork tree can be harvested every 9-10 years during its 200-year life span. The tree is not harmed during the process; it actually allows for greater absorption of CO2 while the bark regrows.
If a tree does reach its end life, two new saplings are planted in its place thus ensuring the cork forest continues to flourish and renew. The harvested cork bark is shredded to a pulp and pressed into long sheets to be used in products. Any leftover cork dust is used to fuel the mills.
If you no longer need your products, cork is compostable. Better yet, you can find a local agency to upcycle your cork or find DIY inspiration online to upcycle your cork.",110,110,USD,3.5,mm,3.5mm,178,cm,178 x 61cm,61,cm,178 x 61cm,1.8,kg,1.8kg,Cork,Grippy,Eco-Friendly; Non-Slip; Lightweight; Alignment Marks; Antimicrobial; Premium,,1,true,4515345334339,yoga-design-lab-cork-mat-mandala-black,YDLAB01,Mat,Collection: best-selling-yoga-mats; Collection: eco-yoga-mats; Collection: full-price-inc-kits; Collection: mats-and-bags; Collection: yoga; Collection: yoga-design-lab; Collection: yoga-mats; ColourName:|Black; feed-cl1-yoga-design-lab; feed-cl2-mat; Manufacturer: yoga-design-lab; Material: Cork; ProductSubCategory: mat; ProductSubCollection: eco-yoga-mats; TaxClass: taxable-goods; Thickness: 3-5mm,2020-07-14T02:24:19+01:00,2020-09-15T13:18:02+01:00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/7259/1939/products/ydl-cork-mat--main-image.jpg?v=1595600415
