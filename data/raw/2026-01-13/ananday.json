Consciously made from plant-based, plastic-free materials — renewable cork + natural tree rubber. No plastic. No harsh chemicals. No toxins. 100% biodegradable.</span></p>\n<p>The premium cork top layer releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet, making it even more slip-resistant with sweat — no towel necessary! And because cork is made from tree bark, it's naturally antimicrobial, preventing grime build-up and odors. <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span>The cork is fused with a cushioned tree rubber base for ultimate comfort to keep joints happy and healthy. Get ready for next level traction, support and stability, no matter how much you move or sweat.</span></p>\n<p>Cork is one of the most earth-friendly materials available. No trees are cut down during harvest. The bark is stripped by hand every 9 years and regenerates itself. A harvested cork tree absorbs up to 5x more CO2 than one that isn’t cultivated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"<strong>Perfect Grip! Best Mat!</strong> I have been practicing yoga for almost 15 years, have tried Manduka, Liforme, Jade, and the Ananday is my favorite. I love that it is sustainable. Definitely recommend!\" — Maria</p>\n<p>\"<strong>Best. Mat. Ever.</strong> Totally non-slip for sweaty hot yoga, supports sensitive knees (I often have to use a blanket for the knees, but not with this mat), great thickness, beautiful, well-made, biodegradable... I've tried so many mats, and this one is undoubtedly my favorite. Love at first use. Using these mats for the rest of my life!\" — Anton</p>\n<p>\"<strong>Finally, a yoga mat where my hands don't slip!</strong> I've had a hard time finding a yoga mat where my sweaty hands don't slide but this cork yoga mat did the trick!\" — Nick<!-- notionvc: 536720b2-e61b-4750-9c21-ce96b926278c --></p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span>1 mat = 1 tree planted 🌳 </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<!-- notionvc: f04001dc-253d-4771-abc3-52ed6b7de3b0 -->\n<h2>Product details<br>\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>72\" x 24\" x 4mm | 5.4 lbs</li>\n<li>Renewable cork + natural tree rubber<br>\n</li>\n<li>Natural, non-toxic, plastic-free<br>\n</li>\n<li>Non-slip and sweat resistant</li>\n<li>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">Rolls out flat and stays put</li>\n<li>Unmatched comfort and stability<meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <br><!-- notionvc: 0c73ffff-df49-4e3e-abf6-02e5a460dd6e -->\n</li>\n<li>Antimicrobial — goodbye funky odors</li>\n<li>Reversible — flip to rubber side for extra traction</li>\n<li>Plastic-free production and packaging<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n</li>\n<li><span>100% biodegradable (<a href=\"https://ananday.com/pages/how-we-pack\">learn how we pack</a>)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>*Traction tip</span> — spray water around hands and feet before practice for extra grip.</p>\n<p>*Advanced tip — if you're practicing inversions like forearm stand and handstand and would like to maximize traction, flip the mat over.<meta charset=\"utf-8\"></p>\n<h2><span>Why cork?</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cork releases an organic grip-enhancing substance when wet so it gets even more grippy with sweat — no towel necessary!</li>\n<li>Made from bark, which forms to protect trees, so it's naturally antimicrobial and <span>stays earthy and fresh day in, day out.</span>\n</li>\n<li>Cork is one of the most earth-friendly materials.
