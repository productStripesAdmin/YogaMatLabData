The mat is 100% biodegradable, so by buying it you aren't increasing your carbon footprint. Care guide: We recommend you clean using a yoga mat cleaner.

The Oak tree is never cut down to harvest cork, rather the bark is stripped by hand! No part of the bark is wasted during cork production. Oak trees regenerate their bark by absorbing five times more Carbon Dioxide than an oak tree that hasn't been harvested.
